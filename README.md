This is a simple overview of the use/purpose of the project.

### WordPress

The content for your website will be stored on a WordPress installation used as a Headless CMS. Itâ€™s important to note that we are only using WordPress to provide an API and add content for the blog. You should not submit a link to a WordPress site, but build your website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript and making a call to the WordPress REST API to fetch the data. 

The project has two aspects:
-	API from your WordPress installation
-	Your website built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript

You will need to add at least 12 blogs for your website. You can use lorem ipsum for paragraphs if you need, but headings, images etc. should all make sense.
